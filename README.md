üìù Project Title:

TryHackMe ‚Äì Investigating with Splunk: Detecting Backdoor Activity

üéØ Objective:

Analyze Windows event logs ingested into Splunk from compromised hosts to detect backdoor user creation, unauthorized remote actions, and malicious PowerShell activity, ultimately identifying indicators of compromise.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:

Splunk (Search & Reporting)

Windows Event Logs

PowerShell Logging

Base64 decoding tools

‚ùå Skills Demonstrated:

Log analysis using Splunk queries

Registry key and user account forensics

Detection of remote admin activity

Decoding encoded PowerShell payloads

Threat hunting and behavioral correlation

Project Overview
This investigation simulates a real-world SOC analysis using Splunk to detect malicious activity across compromised Windows hosts. The task was prompted by suspicious behaviors observed by a fellow analyst, with logs indicating that an attacker created a backdoor user, tampered with registry keys, and executed obfuscated PowerShell scripts. All logs were centralized in Splunk under the main index for triage.

Task Breakdown

‚úèÔ∏è Task 1: Count Ingested Events

‚≠ïÔ∏è Objective: Determine how many events were ingested into the main index.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Method: Use Splunk Search: index=main | stats count

‚úèÔ∏è Task 2: Identify the Backdoor Username

‚≠ïÔ∏è Objective: Find the unauthorized user created by the attacker.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Method: Query for user creation events: index=main EventCode=4720 & Check TargetUserName field.

‚úèÔ∏è Task 3: Locate Registry Key Change

‚≠ïÔ∏è Objective: Identify the registry path modified for persistence.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Method: Search registry modification logs: index=main Registry & Filter by keywords like backup_admin

‚úèÔ∏è Task 4: Detect Impersonated User

‚≠ïÔ∏è Objective: Find which legitimate user account was targeted for impersonation.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Method:Investigate suspicious logon attempts: index=main EventCode=4648 & Look for attempts using high-privilege usernames.

‚úèÔ∏è Task 5: Command Used for Remote Backdoor Creation

‚≠ïÔ∏è Objective: Identify the command used to create the backdoor user remotely.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Method: Look for event logs showing remote command execution: index=main EventCode=4688 & Check for net user or psexec commands.

‚úèÔ∏è Task 6: Count Login Attempts by Backdoor User

‚≠ïÔ∏è Objective: Determine how often the attacker tried logging in with the new user.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Method: Search for logon attempts: index=main TargetUserName="backup_admin" EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625

‚úèÔ∏è Task 7: Identify Infected Host Running PowerShell

‚≠ïÔ∏è Objective: Name the host that executed suspicious PowerShell commands.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Method:Search for PowerShell usage logs: index=main powershell & Filter for suspicious commands.

‚úèÔ∏è Task 8: Count of Malicious PowerShell Events

‚≠ïÔ∏è Objective: Count how many PowerShell logs were generated from the malicious execution.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Method: Search: index=main host="DC1-THM-AD" process="powershell.exe"

‚úèÔ∏è Task 9: Identify the Full URL in PowerShell Request

‚≠ïÔ∏è Objective: Find the full web address used in the PowerShell script.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Method: Extract base64 strings and decode manually or via script & Look inside CommandLine field for encoded strings.

üîç Analysis and Reflection
üí° Challenges Faced:

Isolating encoded PowerShell from benign scripts.

Navigating verbose logs to find meaningful signals.

Correlating user creation with registry persistence.

üí° Lessons Learned:

Registry key analysis is vital for detecting hidden users.

PowerShell logs often reveal clear indicators of attack.

Adversaries prefer creating stealthy users and disabling visibility.

üí° Relevance to SOC Analyst Roles:

Shows how lateral movement and backdoors appear in logs.

Enhances familiarity with Splunk‚Äôs search capabilities.

Builds real-world correlation and alert triage skills.

üí° Relevance to Penetration Testing / Red Teaming:

Highlights attacker TTPs involving backdoor user creation.

Offers a blueprint for mimicking persistent access techniques.

Underscores need for defenders to monitor encoded script behavior.

‚úÖ Conclusion
üí° Summary:

Detected anomalous behavior from Windows event logs using Splunk. Identified unauthorized user backup_admin, uncovered registry persistence via UserList, tracked attacker impersonation, and analyzed encoded PowerShell used to download a payload from maliciousdomain.live.

üí° Skills Gained:

Windows event log triage in Splunk

User and registry change tracking

PowerShell script decoding

Detection of remote administration activity

üí° Next Steps:

Create Splunk alerts for EventCode 4720 + unknown usernames.

Enable base64 decoding plugins to auto-flag suspicious scripts.

Correlate with EDR and network logs to track payload delivery.
